**Data visualization Project**-  ARTIFICIAL SATELLITES AROUND EARTH:  In-depth details on the 6,718 satellites currently orbiting Earth, including their country of origin, purpose, and other operational details. 
Assembled by experts at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), the Satellite Database is a listing of the more than 6,718 operational satellites currently in orbit around Earth. Our intent in producing the database is to create a research tool for specialists and non-specialists alike by collecting open-source information on operational satellites and presenting it in a format that can be easily manipulated for research and analysis.



**Data Engineering Project**- DATA ENGINEERING LIFECYCLE: The purpose of this project to get hands-on experience of whole Data engineering lifecycle of handling dataset from staging to production, ingestion. 
Process is -> We will start with Account data in Salesforce. We will then grab that data using an automated ETL tool (Airbyte) and bring that data into Snowflake, a popular cloud-based data warehousing platform. Creating database, schemas and tables. 
Once objects are created using SQL in Snowflake, surface the data into staging tables(clean the data as needed) and copy the data into Prod tables. Now that the data is ready to consume, we are going to create a connection to Snowflake from Tableau Desktop. Dashboard is built using the data in snowflake. The goal of this project is to simulate the end to end movement of data from ingestion to serving.



**Linear Regression Project** - CAR PRICE PREDICTION:  In the automotive sector, pricing analytics play an essential role for both companies and individuals to assess the market price of a vehicle before putting it on sale or buying it. 
There are many automobile companies aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit in US. Predicting car prices involves determining a vehicle's market worth based on various attributes like brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and overall state. This prediction holds significant value for the auto industry, aiding both prospective buyers and sellers in understanding pricing and making educated decisions regarding vehicle transactions.



**Cloud Computing Project** - DevOps, CloudOps, AI, CI/CD, Cloud storage of IBM cloud features, hands-on, presentation.


**Machine Learning Project** - Worked on three projects of different datasets with Data Loading and Exploration, Data Preprocessing, Encoding, Dimensionality Reduction for Segmentation with different visualizations:
_Project 1_: Predicting Instagram Post Likes Using Regression Techniques- Developed a regression model to predict the number of likes on Instagram posts based on features such as the number of tags, comments, and days since posting.
_Project 2_: Clustering Analysis on Glass Dataset - Applied unsupervised learning to segment glass types based on chemical composition (e.g., refractive index, weight percentages of oxides) using clustering techniques.
_Project 3_: Market Basket Analysis and Customer Segmentation Preprocessing -  Preprocessed a retail dataset for Market Basket Analysis to identify frequently purchased product combinations and prepared data for customer segmentation using unsupervised learning.



**Splunk Project** - Created the Organa IoT CyberSec app to analyze cybersecurity events in IoT systems, leveraging real-world telemetry data simulated via the UNSW-NB15 datasetto detect modern attack types (e.g., Fuzzers, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Worms) on IoT protocols.Designed intuitive dashboard panels for time-based attack tracking, sensor behavior comparison, and feature-wise analysis across seven IoT devices (e.g., GPS Tracker, Fridge, Thermostat, Garage Door).
